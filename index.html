                                Andres Iniesta was born in a small village called Fuentealbilla, in the province of
                                Albacete, Castile–La Mancha, Spain. It was in this club where Iniesta spent the very
                                early years of his youth career as a footballer. During Iniesta's stay at Albacete, he
                                attracted the attention of scouts from clubs in Spain, and his parents decided to
                                travel to Barcelona to enroll him in the youth ranks.

                                At age 12, Iniesta joined FC Barcelona's youth academy - "<i>La Masia</i>." He excelled
                                as a youth player, and was team captain of the U-15 team that won the Nike Premier Cup
                                in 1999. He scored a last minute goal in the final, which gave Barcelona the victory,
                                and was also named player of the tournament.

                                Iniesta played with Barcelona's B team for a short time, but played his first official
                                match with FC Barcelona in October 2002. It was at Barcelona where Iniesta spent the
                                major part of his career as a professional footballer. His role was vital as a
                                playmaker in the seasons to come, and he developed into a more mature footballer. As
                                Iniesta developed, he became better and better, and soon evolved into an indispensable
                                player for FC Barcelona. In the pre-season of 2007, he helped the team win the Joan
                                Gamper Trophy, and scored important goals in the league games, and Champions League.

                                In 2008, Iniesta was elected fourth-captain of the team, cementing him as one of the
                                most important squad members and one of the leaders. In a semi-final match against
                                Chelsea FC, he scored a goal in the final minute of extra time, that helped Barcelona
                                go through to the final.
