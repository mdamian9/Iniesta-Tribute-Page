                                Andres Iniesta was born in a small village called Fuentealbilla, in the province of
                                Albacete, Castile–La Mancha, Spain. It was in this club where Iniesta spent the very
                                early
                                years of his youth career as a footballer. During Iniesta's stay at Albacete, he
                                attracted
                                the attention of
                                scouts from clubs in Spain, and his parents decided to travel to Barcelona to enroll
                                him in
                                the youth ranks.
