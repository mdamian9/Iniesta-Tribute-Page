                                Andres Iniesta was born in a small village called Fuentealbilla, in the province of
                                Albacete, Castile–La Mancha, Spain. It was in this club where Iniesta spent the very
                                early years of his youth career as a footballer. During Iniesta's stay at Albacete, he
                                attracted the attention of scouts from clubs in Spain, and his parents decided to
                                travel to Barcelona to enroll him in the youth ranks.

                            <li>
                                At age 12, Iniesta joined FC Barcelona's youth academy - "<i>La Masia</i>." He excelled
                                as a youth player, and was team captain of the U-15 team that won the Nike Premier Cup
                                in 1999. He scored a last minute goal in the final, which gave Barcelona the victory,
                                and was also named player of the tournament.

                                Iniesta played with Barcelona's B team for a short time, but played his first official
                                match with FC Barcelona in October 2002. It was at Barcelona where Iniesta spent the
                                major part of his career as a professional footballer. His role was vital as a
                                playmaker in the seasons to come, and he developed into a more mature footballer. As
                                Iniesta developed, he became better and better, and soon evolved into an indispensable
                                player for FC Barcelona. In the pre-season of 2007, he helped the team win the Joan
                                Gamper Trophy, and scored important goals in the league games, and Champions League.

                                In 2008, Iniesta was elected fourth-captain of the team, cementing him as one of the
                                most important squad members and one of the leaders. In 2009 during a semi-final match
                                against Chelsea FC, he scored a goal in the final minute of extra time, that helped
                                Barcelona go through to the final. Later that year, he was 4th place for the Ballon
                                d'Or, and 5th place for the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him among the
                                top 5 footballers on the planet.

                                During the 2009-2010 season, Iniesta helped Barcelona achieve 99 points - a record
                                number. This secured the league title for them that season. Iniesta went on to win
                                the 2010-2011 La Liga season again with Barcelona, scoring important goals and making
                                important plays. More and more trophies followed the following years, with Iniesta
                                being named as captain of the club after Xavi's departure. He helped Barcelona win the
                                Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup in 2015. He signed a lifetime
                                contract with Barcelona, but evenually left the club in 2018, making him one of the
                                most important players in the history of the club.

                                Andres Iniesta has also been called up to play for the Spanish National Team, and has
                                been one of their more important figures in the past years. His first official match
                                with Spain was in 2006, during a friendly match against Russia. He was then called up
                                for international duty to participate in the World Cup that year.

                                Since his first call up for Spain, Iniesta became one of Spain's most important
                                players. He was crucial to the team when they won the UEFA Euro Cup in 2008, and in
                                2010, Iniesta achieved world glory when he helped Spain reach the FIFA World Cup final,
                                and gave them the victory in the 116th minute of the match. Iniesta was also a key
                                figure in 2012 for Spain, helping them win the UEFA Euro Cup for the second time in a
                                row.

                                In 2013, Iniesta helped Spain reach the final of the 2013 Confederations Cup, where
                                they eventually lost to the host nation, Brazil. He was awarded the Silver Ball award,
                                for being the second best player of the tournament. At the UEFA Euro 2016, Spain did
                                not perform as well as they had before and were knocked out, and a smiliar scenario
                                happened at the 2018 World Cup, where Spain was eliminated in penalty kicks. It was
                                here where Iniesta decided to retire from international football.
