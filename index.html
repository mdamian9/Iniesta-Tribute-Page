                            Andres Iniesta was born in a small village called Fuentealbilla, in the province of
                            Albacete, Castile–La Mancha, Spain. It was in this club where Iniesta spent the very early
                            years of his youth career as a footballer. During Iniesta's stay at Albacete, he attracted
                            the attention of
                            scouts from clubs in Spain, and his parents decided to travel to Barcelona to enroll him in
                            the youth ranks.
